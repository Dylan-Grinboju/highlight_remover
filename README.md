# Remove highlight from PDFs

# PDF Color Modifier Tool

This tool processes PDF files in a selected folder and replaces yellow colors with white. The modified PDFs are saved in a new folder called `processed_PDFs`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyMuPDF library (`pip install pymupdf`)

## How to Use
1. Run the script:
   ```
   python highlight_remover.py
   ```
2. Select a folder with PDF files when prompted.
3. The processed PDFs will be saved in a subfolder named `processed_PDFs` inside the selected folder.

That's it! ðŸŽ‰

## Notes
- The script replaces yellow (`1 1 0`) with white (`1 1 1`) in the PDF. It will not work (yet) for other shades of yellow.

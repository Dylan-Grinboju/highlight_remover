# PDF Processing Tool

This is a Python-based tool for processing PDF files. It provides two main functionalities: 
1. **Faster Program** - Modifies the colors in a PDF directly.
2. **Slower Program** - Converts PDF pages to images for pixel-level image processing before re-assembling them back into a PDF.

## Features

### 1. Faster Program (Modify PDF Colors)
- Replaces just yellow in the PDF with white directly using PDF streams.
- Suitable for users looking for a quick solution.

### 2. Slower Program (Page-by-Page Image Processing)
- Converts PDFs to images for detailed processing.
- Processes each page by converting non-white, non-black pixels into white based on a defined threshold.
- Reassembles processed images back into a single PDF.
- Lowers the quality of the PDF!.
- Takes a lot longer

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required Python libraries:
  - `PyMuPDF` (`fitz`)
  - `Pillow` (`PIL`)

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install PyMuPDF Pillow
```

## How to Use

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python highlight_remover.py
   ```

2. Select a folder containing the PDF files to process when prompted.

3. Choose the program to run:
   - **Faster Program**: Enter `f` and press Enter.
   - **Slower Program**: Enter `s` and press Enter.

4. The processed files will be saved in a new folder named `processed_PDFs` within the selected folder.

## Temporary Files

The **Slower Program** creates temporary image files during processing. These files are automatically cleaned up once processing is complete.

    example1.pdf
    example2.pdf
```

### Output
```plaintext
/path/to/folder/

    example2.pdf
    processed_PDFs/
        processed_example1.pdf
        processed_example2.pdf
```
